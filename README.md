Currently there is only a simplified print it yourself version. This is meant for people not wanting to invest in more extrusions and side plates. you simply have to print the parts. and you can reuse your old top plate and corner pieces.

NOTE, a fully parametric design using extrusions is under design though it will take longer to finalise. The next design will have a bigger focus on adding things like lights, can wiring and other QOL / fancypants features.
